# CFG
Hey, guys, hey there ! 
Today, we are proud to present our new project.

CFG is a version of the famous Connect 4. Only, a gravity system is added... Instead of just playing, why not break your head a little ?

My name is Gaspard Lebaube and I am with my beautiful colleague Kamil Leys. 

We would first like to thank some people who helped us for this project from time to time indirectly...

We thank the creators:

Here is our beautiful game :

IMG

Yes, just a tray of 10x10 boxes...
Not much, yes, but potential...
Okay, now, if I tell you there are chips, and... that’s it : a tray and chips... yes! 

It’s already a good base. Who wants better ?
Me ?! I am indeed a bit demanding...

So maybe I’ll add some rules, huh ? 
There, as soon as you line up 4 chips, you have won... But... It reminds me of a game... Of course not !

Well I know that there you find the game far too complicated, indeed it is so far a torture for your brain... So watch out, it’ll get hot :

We’re sure Earth... right ? 
Good well, I must see revealed that there is gravity ! No, it’s not a joke !

So let’s resume... So there is a gravity that is naturally towards the bottom of the plateau... IF YOU DON’T TURN IT OVER OF COURSE !!! 
So the chips will go to the bottom of it...

Now shift the gravity (which we will symbolize as a line) and put it in the middle of the tray. 
The chips that will be placed on top will land at this line... The tokens that will be placed at the bottom, will go back to the same line...

But it’s not over ! Hehe...
Now that we have our horizontal line, add a vertical line...
The chips will be drawn to the middle of the board! 

And you just have to assemble the gravity and the tray... and line up your 4 chips! 

Simple ? Test it !
